# Junior Implementation Specialist - Coding Challenge - Section #1

To get started with this challenge, copy this repository to your own repository using the "Fork" icon in the top right. 

You can then download the code to your machine by clicking on the code button then click "Download Zip".

Once you're happy with your code, re-upload the files you've changed by clicking on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files".

For us to be able to see your work, we'll need you to host this on github pages. To do this, go into the repository settings, then pages. Within pages, select the drop down and select "Master" and click save.
